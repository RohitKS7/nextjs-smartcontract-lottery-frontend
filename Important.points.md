# Setup

1. Install Nextjs with `yarn create next-app .` (FULLSTOP IS IMPORTANT)

2. Install React-Moralis to build web3 frontend easily.

3. Install "Web3UIKit" = Beautiful and Lightweight UI components for web3 developers. This UI library will speed up your Dapp development no matter which chain you build on.

4. Create Header.jsx

5. Create LotteryEntrance.jsx

6. Go back to contract directory and run local hardhat node chain.

7. Create a new file "update-frontend-deploy" script into deploy folder in contract directory. This script will create constants (abi stuff) folder automatically everytime we update the backend files.
